# guess_the_word
A beginner‑friendly Python word guessing game using the random module. The program selects a word at random from a list, and the player tries to guess it through simple console input. Built as my very first project to practice loops, conditionals, and string handling while learning GitHub basics.

📚 Purpose
This project helped me:
- Learn how to use the random module
- Practice loops, conditionals, and string handling
- Share my first program on GitHub

🏆 Future Ideas
- Add difficulty levels
- Include a scoring system
- Build a GUI or web version
